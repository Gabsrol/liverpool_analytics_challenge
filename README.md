# Liverpool Analytics Challenge

This repository gather the code for my contribution to Friends of Tracking challenge that you can find in this [Medium post](https://medium.com/@gabs.rol43/analysing-liverpool-attack-e6d32c6c9a57).

Thanks to @lastrowview for the datasets and to Friends of Tracking for their tutorials. 

## Repository description

* [**liverpool_goals_analysis.ipynb**](https://github.com/Gabsrol/liverpool_analytics_challenge/blob/master/liverpool_goals_analysis.ipynb) notebook presents the code used to generate the figures displayed in the Medium post. **This is the first notebook to open** to understand the repository and what you have to run to have all the data.
* [**make_contribution_animations**](https://github.com/Gabsrol/liverpool_analytics_challenge/blob/master/make_animations.ipynb) notebook presents the code I used to generate the videos displayed in the Medium post.
* [**pitch_control_and_off_ball_scoring_model.ipynb**](https://github.com/Gabsrol/liverpool_analytics_challenge/blob/master/pitch_control_and_off_ball_scoring_model.ipynb) where I detailed the approach I used to create pitch control model.
* [all_goals_animation.ipynb](https://github.com/Gabsrol/liverpool_analytics_challenge/blob/master/all_goals_animation.ipynb) where I detail how to realise a video with all goals players moves.
* [convert_data_to_metrica.ipynb](https://github.com/Gabsrol/liverpool_analytics_challenge/blob/master/convert_data_to_metrica.ipynb) details how to convert Last Row data to Metrica format.
* [expected_goals_model](https://github.com/Gabsrol/liverpool_analytics_challenge/blob/master/expected_goals_model.ipynb) where I follow FoT tutorial to build my expected goals model
* [time_to_reach_a_location.ipynb](https://github.com/Gabsrol/liverpool_analytics_challenge/blob/master/time_to_reach_a_location.ipynb) where I detail two approaches to calculate the time it takes a soccer player to reach a point.

## Data used

To study Liverpool attack, I used the data provided by @lastrowview that you can find  [here](https://github.com/Friends-of-Tracking-Data-FoTD/Last-Row).

I also used metrica sample data to illustrate pitch control model. You can find the data [here](https://github.com/Gabsrol/liverpool_analytics_challenge/blob/master/convert_data_to_metrica.ipynb)

Finally, to developp expected goals model, I used wyscout data, that you can find [here](https://figshare.com/collections/Soccer_match_event_dataset/4415000/2)
